Though candidates of many other categories often enjoy age relaxation, and so can appear in most government jobs even after 28 or 30 years of age. This luxury is not generally available to students who fall in the general category. 

If you are a general category student, and are approaching 30 years of age, then you might be apprehensive of your chances of landing in a government job. But don’t worry!

In this article, we will explore all the government job options that are available even after 30 years for general category students. Of course, these jobs will be open to other category students too.

  <b>A Word of Caution</b><br>

However, in my opinion you should not waste too much time in government exam preparation. Two or three years are more than enough. 

If you are hell bent on getting a government job, you should also create a backup plan – get into a private job, or a government job that allows you to study for better exams. Or get enrolled in some good education program, e.g. LLB, Psychology, B. Ed. etc. So that you have other options available to you, even if you fail in your main goal. Otherwise, you may feel a lot of stress. 

Also, getting a masters degree is a good idea. Some government jobs are available only for post-graduates, and competition is much less in such exams. You need not even go to college. You can do it from the comfort of your home, by enrolling in IGNOU. Tuition fee of IGNOU is pretty low too. You may complete your post-graduation by just spending 10-15k. 

And many jobs that are open after 30 years, generally require you to have some relevant experience (3, 5 or 7 years in general). Relevant experience means an experience that is in the same field in which you are applying.

  <b>Note</b><br>

If you are already in a government job, and are looking for better job opportunities, then the first thing you should explore is the internal departmental exam. 

Many governments, PSUs, and public sector banks (PSBs) conduct internal exams for promotion. For example, if you are a clerk in SBI bank, then you can give IBPS PO, SBI PO exams to become an officer. But must easier option would be to give the internal SBI exam to become bank officer in SBI. Competition will be much less there.

## Government Jobs for any Graduate after age 30

Let’s start with the government jobs that are available for graduates of any stream. 

### UPSC and State PSC

Most state PSC exams have an upper age limit of 35 to 40 years. So, you can give these exams much after you turn 30. However, it may not be a very good idea to invest too much time here. That’s because competition is very high in these exams, seats are very limited, results are often delayed, and recruitment process is not very transparent. So, luck plays a big factor in these exams.

You can also give UPSC Civil Services exam till 32 years of age now. Because of some court cases and controversy in the past, UPSC raised the upper age limit for general candidates to 32 years (from 30 years). Maximum number of attempts were also increased from 4 to 6.

  <b>Note</b><br>

You need not have any job experience to sit in these exams. However, if you are over 30 years and have not done any job till now, you may be asked some tough questions in the interview.

### Teacher and Professor jobs

If you have qualified National Eligibility Test (NET), or have done your PhD, then you may apply for the jobs of teachers and professors in government schools and colleges. Upper age limit for many of these jobs is over 30 years, and many have no upper age limit at all. 

### NABARD Grade B

You may sit in the exam for NABARD Grade B officers even till the age of 32 years. But you must be a post-graduate. 

Moreover, vacancies are very low, and so competition is very high. The syllabus is also pretty wide, from agriculture, to management topics. 

### Deputy Director and Assistant Director

Central government and state governments release vacancies for Deputy Director and Assistant Director posts on a regular basis. These jobs are for people with a lot of experience and knowledge. Sometimes experience required is over 10-15 years. So, these jobs are definitely not for freshers, or even middle management guys. These are kind of lateral entries into government sector. 

Similarly, many PSUs (e.g. NTPC, BHEL, ONGC, etc.) also release vacancies for Manager and Deputy Managers on a regular basis.  

Even people who have been working as director or CEO, CFO, etc. in corporate sector can apply for these posts. So, if you are a private sector employee, but now want to switch to government sector for more job security, or better work-life balance, you may do so. 

### Bank Specialist Officers (SO)

Banks also recruit specialist officers in various streams, e.g. law, IT, etc. In some of these jobs they require candidates to have some experience of 2-3 years. Once recruited, these candidates are given higher level posts. So, if you have already worked in some bank, or some law firm, or IT company for some years, then you may apply for these jobs. Upper age limit for these jobs is generally over 30 years. 

One of my friends joined SBI as IT officer after working in HCL (as software engineer) for more than 3 years. Because of higher qualification and experience demands, competition is generally lower in such exams. 

### Territorial Army

Territorial army also recruits people over 30 years of age. They call the people who are working in corporate sector, or PSUs, or playing some sports, and give them army ranks. 

You just have to fill a form on their website, and then you may get a call from them for an interview. There’s no exam as such for these jobs. 


## Government Jobs for Law students after age 30

If you are a law student, then you can always practice or teach. So, these options are always available to you. Moreover, there are some government jobs too that you can get into even after 30 years of age. 

### Lower and Higher Judiciary Exams

In most Lower Judiciary exams of most states, the age limit is 35 years. So, you can become a judicial magistrate even after 30 years of age. You just need a LLB degree. 

Though if you fail to get selected in Lower Judicial Service exam, you may give an exam for Higher Judicial Service too, later on in your life. You must have a LLB degree and at least 7 years of experience as a lawyer. Age limit in such exams is around 35-45 years.

### Public Prosecutors (Government lawyers)

Central and State governments appoint their own lawyers to represent them in the cases filed against them. These lawyers are called Assistant District Prosecution Officers (ADPO), or Assistant Public Prosecutor Officers (APPO). 

You need to have at least 7 years of experience as a lawyer to be selected as a Public Prosecutor. The age limit is 35-45 years. 

If you fulfil the above criteria, then you may sit in an exam conducted by UPSC. Once you clear that exam, you will just have to clear an interview round.
