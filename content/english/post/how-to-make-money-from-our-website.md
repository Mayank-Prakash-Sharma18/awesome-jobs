If you already have a website or blog and are looking to monetise it, you have landed at the right spot. In this article, we will explore some of the most famous methods via which people make money from their websites. 

There are various methods to earn money online. However, we are going to focus on the five most common ones.

## By running Ads

This is the most popular method to earn money online and probably the first one that new bloggers often use to earn their first income.

However, you will only get pennies vis this method, kind of a pocket money. In one of my websites, I get over 10 thousand traffic per month and I only earn around $4-7 per month via ***Google AdSense***. 

Though you may increase your Ad revenue by using other Ad services (such as ***AdThrive, Ezoic***, etc.), but even then, it won’t be sufficient to provide you a full-time income.

One other method people often opt for is ***selling ad space*** on their digital assets manually. That is, instead of taking help of ad agencies or services like Google AdSense, they manually approach businesses that may be willing to put their ads on their website. 

For example, if you have an educational blog, many educational institutes and coaching classes may be more than willing to pay money to you in return of their promotion. This promotion maybe in form of advertisements or even some articles that show them in a good light. Though I personally avoid writing articles in return of money, as that may lead to biased information to our readers. Ethics are important, and as a blogger we should try to present only the truth to our readers. 


## Affiliate Marketing

This is a better method to earn revenues via your website or blog. Here, you sell products and services of others and get some commission on each sale made. The most famous affiliate marketing program is of course Amazon. 

But there are many more. Let’s list down a few of them for you:

* <a href="https://www.cj.com/" target="_blank" title="Commission junction" class="mak-link">Commission junction</a>
* <a href="https://shareasale.com/" target="_blank" title="ShareASale" class="mak-link">ShareASale</a>
* <a href="https://www.ysense.com/" target="_blank" title="ySense" class="mak-link">ySense</a>


## Sell your own Products

But why sell others’ products, if you have your own. If you can make your products, digital or otherwise, you may sell them online on your website or via your social media accounts like Facebook, Twitter, etc. If you really want to make a ton of money, this is the way to go. 

Most of the common products sold online by new entrepreneurs are e-books, photographs, software, apps, etc. 

For this purpose, you may make an e-commerce site or integrate an online store in your website. In WordPress it can easily be achieved by using plugins such as Shopify, WooCommerce, etc. Then you will need to integrate your online store with some payment gateway, so that people may do online transactions. You may explore many payment gateways for this purpose, such as:
* Instamojo
* Payu
* Razorpay
* Stripe
* PayPal
* Snipcart – esp, to get payments from US/UK/Canada, as it allows us to get payments from Stripe and PayPal. 

However, even if you don’t have a website on WordPress, you can still make online stores on some third-party websites and link them to your website. For example, in case of most of my websites, I often make my online stores on the website of payment gateway service providers such as Instamojo and Payu.

## Sell your own Service

You may also sell services online. Say you are a career counsellor, or a psychologist, or even a lawyer. You may start providing your services online to a wide variety of customers via your website. 

Maybe you may start an online course on your website. In WordPress there are a couple of good plugins for setting up an online course website, e.g. LifterLMS, MemberPress, etc. 


## Donations

Now, the last and probably the least preferred method is of donations. You may ask your readers to donate money to you, buy you a coffee, etc., to enable you to keep on working for free, grow your website, and provide awesome content or products for people to use. 

This may really be helpful if you are a new online entrepreneur and are working alone. It won’t make you rich. But just like in case of Ads, it may help you earn some pocket money of sorts. 
Though this method is more often used by NGOs and social organizations to raise money for a certain cause. 

But how to implement it effectively on our website?

That’s pretty easy nowadays. Some payment gateways like Razorpay allows us to embed Donation Buttons on our website. You need not do any coding. For more <a href="https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-button/donations/" target="_blank" title="Razorpay" class="mak-link">you may read this.</a>

You may also use this button for Subscription type services provided by you, e.g. monthly or yearly magazines, yearly membership of a course on your website, etc.

## Winding Up

Well, these are the main five methods via which people earn money from their website. Though there are multitudes of other options available too. We will just enlist them down below. 
* Selling Sponsored Posts
* Generating Leads for big companies or selling email list of your subscribers (though keep in mind the data privacy laws of your country)
* Create website for others or sell your own website. Generally, you will get to sell your website at 25-30 times its monthly revenue. Some of the leading platforms for selling a website are <a href="https://flippa.com/" target="_blank" title="Flippa" class="mak-link">Flippa</a>, <a href="https://www.webuywebsites.net/" target="_blank" title="We Buy Websites" class="mak-link">We Buy Websites</a>, and <a href="https://feinternational.com/" target="_blank" title="FEInternational" class="mak-link">FEInternational.</a>
