## Benefits of being an online tutor

### Perks of being a freelancer: 
You may earn as much you want and renumeration is good. You are not bound with the whims and fancies of some organization. 

### No travel required: 
You need not hop on a cab 3-4 times a day to go to different classrooms for your classes. You just need to open up your laptop (with sound internet connection) from the comfort of your home. As a trainer myself, I can assure you that if you are taking classes for various education centres, there is a lot of travelling involved. It’s not only a waste of time but also stressful. 

### Better time-management: 
You will have a lot of spare time, not only at the end of the day but also between online classes. You may utilize it for your research or spend quality time with your family and enjoy the fruits of a better work-life balance. 

### Flexi-time and global reach: 
As an online tutor you will have flexibility of working hours. So, if you are a night person you can teach someone in USA or Canada. If you are a morning person, you can cater to Australian students. So, you have control not only on the number of working hours, but also on the time of working hours. Also, the world will be your stage to showcase your skills. With no geographical boundaries the avenues of growth increase exponentially. 

### Degree not a major necessity: 
Online tutoring does not require you to have any particular degree. If you have knowledge and a knack of teaching, you will go a long way. Though some online tutoring websites do demand specific educational background or experience, but there are enough avenues where even freshers may showcase their teaching skills. If you have subject expertise and can help your students in achieving their goals, you will succeed. 

## How much money can we make by teaching online?

Well there’s no straight forward answer to that, as a lot of factors are involved. How much you earn online depends on the subject you teach, how much you teach, whether you are teaching individual students or a group of students etc. If you are experienced then you may expect to earn more. But then it’s true for any job. 
Some sites will even let you set your own fees. Depending on all these factors you may easily earn anything from 10k to 100k (i.e. ten thousand to 1 lakh) or even more. 

## Can you be an online tutor?

Yes, you can be! Just make sure you have the following:

### Skill and Will:
You need to be an expert in your field, should have a passion for teaching and good communication skills. You should know how to explain even complex concepts in a simple manner. Rest will happen on its own. Other things on this list are rudimentary. But let’s read out the rest of the list for the sake of avoiding Zeigarnik effect. 

### Laptop/Desktop:
You need to have a laptop or desktop, preferable with a camera if you want to show your face. 

### Mic:
What you definitely need is a good quality mic, e.g. a Rode mic with pop screen. It’s really essential if you are recording your lessons for platforms like YouTube. But for starters any decent mic will do, even your run-of-the-mill earphones. 

### Digital pen and writing pad:
Some companies provide it to you, but some don’t. If you are even a bit sincere in your efforts towards online tutoring then I suggest that you should definitely buy one for yourself. 

### Software:
The kind of software you require may depend on the platform you aim to teach on. Most online tutoring websites will allow you to use their own software platforms. But if you are keen on making your own education video lectures, then you should have basic knowledge of some software like Microsoft Power Point, some Video editing tool like Camtasia and maybe some Audio editing tools too, e.g. Audacity. 

### Internet Connection:
Needless to say, you should have a good internet connection, preferably a WiFi that will allow you to work from anywhere in the house.

## Procedures involved in becoming an online tutor

The procedure will vary from website to website. You will have to go through their websites for it and then apply. 

The first thing you need to do is to choose what subject you will teach. Some online teaching platforms even let you choose more than one subject. But beware, do not bite off more than you can chew!

Generally, these online education portals demand you to submit a copy of your educational and experience related certificates (don’t submit your originals), along with your resume. It may be followed by a test or an interview or both. You may also be asked to give a live demo or submit a recorded demo lecture on a topic of your choice. 

## List of sites providing online tutoring jobs

On this platform (<a href="https://unacademy.com/" target="_blank" class="mak-link">Unacademy</a>) you can make a video lecture series by using Microsoft Power Point Presentation (PPT). You need not take live classes.

## International websites

There are some international websites too where you may try your hand. But their entry procedure may be a bit lengthy and complex. You may try your hands here once you have gained some experience on Indian online tutoring websites. I am listing some of the UK/USA based tutoring portals here for you:

<a href="https://www.tutor.com/" target="_blank" class="mak-link">Tutor</a>, Tutorme, TutorVista, MyTutor24, Brainfuse, Skooli

Using these websites you can earn very decent amount of money by either working full-time or part-time. If teaching is your passion then these online platforms will help you graduate into a professional. 

## Alternatives to famous online tutoring sites

### Online teaching jobs

You may also make profile on famous job search engines like naukri.com, glassdoor.com, shine.com etc. Online teaching jobs are often posted on these websites.

### YouTube channel

Another alternative is to create your own YouTube channel. It’s a route which will test your patience as it will take consistent efforts on your end for atleast a year before your channel starts getting some traction. But if you can pull it off then it will create your brand value in the education market and will open numerous business options before you too. 

### Online course sites

You may also create your own video course and upload it on online course sites like Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/). Here instead of providing live classes, you will upload your pre-recorded lectures. The subject and topic can be anything of your choice, ranging from Digital Marketing, to Programming languages and English etc. 

Though it might take you some time to make your video course, the positive side is that once you are done you will get paid whenever anyone buys your product. Moreover, you will be the sole owner of whatever you create and whatever you earn. But you may have to put in some effort to market your course initially. If you have created good quality lectures, your course will sell like hot cakes pretty soon. 

## Another option for absolute beginners

If you are an absolute beginner and have yet not perfected your teaching craft or lack confidence in your subject knowledge, you may still earn while working in your area of interest. You can be a content developer or become a Q&A expert. And in due course of time you may start taking classes when you fell like you are ready. 

### Chegg 

<a href="https://www.cheggindia.com/" target="_blank" class="mak-link">CheggIndia</a> is really a good option for beginners. Many of the teachers first work as content developers and get a command over the subject of their choice. CheggIndia is an online platform that pays you on sharing your subject-specific knowledge. You need not give any video lecture. 

You are supposed to answer the questions posted on their website. You can choose the question you are comfortable in answering. 

Subjects – Management, Finance, Computer Science, Mathematics, Geography etc. 

The best thing is that you will be paid as soon as you answer some question correctly. The more you answer the more you get. As per their website you may earn upto 1 lakh per month. 

The amount paid per question varies a bit from subject to subject. 

You will need to go through an online screening and then document verification to become their Q&A expert.
