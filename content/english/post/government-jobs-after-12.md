However, to clear the skill test, you must be good at general typing and ***shorthand***.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Shorthand is a faster way to write something, by making use of an abbreviated symbolic writing method. In fact, the process of writing in shorthand is called ***stenography***. So, if you want to be a Stenographer, then it’s obvious that you should be skilful in shorthand typing.
