You like uniform, don’t you? 

Well, why shouldn’t anyone. I also used to like men in uniform, still do.

A career in defence sector is not only a secure one, but also royal and honourable. People in uniforms look so smart and handsome, and the lifestyle they live can make even IAS, IPS envy them. 

Have you been to a Cantonment area? It’s always clean, well-kept and surrounded by greenery. As an armed force officer or soldier/jawan, you can participate in various sports, do awesome activities like horse-riding, cycling, swimming, etc. Your family will also enjoy these facilities. And you will get to go to places in India and world that very few people are allowed to. 

Then there is the charm of guns, various self-defence arts that you will learn, and the physical activities you will do to remain fit. It’s an awesome lifestyle.

  <b>Note</b><br>

I was selected in Indian Airforce in 2009 as Flight Lieutenant (Technical Branch). I cleared my SSB in Varanasi and gave my medical test in Delhi. Just like SSB, even their medical tests last for 3-4 days. They check everything! I gave eye test, ear test, ECG, ultrasound test, urine test, etc. 
Will write about that experience of mine in a separate article. 
</div>

In this article, we will focus solely on the armed forces of India, i.e. Army, Navy, and Air Force. These work under the Ministry of Defence. We will discuss about paramilitary forces (e.g. BSF, CISF, CRPF, etc.), which work under Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in a separate article.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Coastal Guards are considered as the fourth armed force of India. They also work under the Ministry of Defence. 

However, they are not a full-fledged military force. They work in coordination with Navy, and in times of war their resources (man, material, money) may be transferred to the Navy. Unlike Army/Navy/Air Force, they are governed by Central Civil Services Rules. 

Earlier they used to work under Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and recently the Home Ministry demanded that Coastal Guards should come under them again. But Ministry of Defence objected to this proposal.

## Career in defence after 12th

### National Defence Academy (NDA)

12th pass or students appearing in 12th can appear in NDA exams (NDA I and NDA II exams). There’s no minimum percentage requirement. 

Students are admitted to NDA (for Army, Navy and Air Force), as well as Naval Academy (NA) through these exams. NDA exams are conducted two times a year. 

You will get into Army and Navy infantry, or become Air Force pilot through this.

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

If you want to become an Air Force pilot, NDA exams are the only way after 12th. 
</div>

Only science stream students can apply for Air Force and Navy, i.e. those having Maths, Physics, Chemistry. However, to get into Army, you just need to have Maths. So, even commerce stream students may apply for Army, if they had Maths as a subject in 12th. 

This is the main route of getting into armed forces of India. Though there are other routes too. But people who graduate from NDA dominate the armed forces of India. 

For example, I got into Air Force after graduation (I was already working as a software engineer in an MNC at that time.) As I was an engineer, I appeared in Technical Branch recruitment drive (it was a fast-track recruitment drive). I would have worked in radar systems, maintain fighter planes, checking and certifying if they are safe to fly for the early morning sorties (4 AM and before). However, the pilots dominate the Air Force, they take risks and are the tip of the sword and so they get faster promotions too (as compared to engineers, or logistic people).

  <b>Note</b><br>

Now, even females can appear in these NDA exams. 
</div>

### Technical Entry Scheme (TES) and 10+2 (B. Tech) Cadet Entry Scheme

Technical Entry Scheme (TES) and 10+2 (B. Tech) Cadet Entry Scheme are alternative routes to get into Army and Navy after 12th. 

Technical Entry Scheme (TES) is for Army, and 10+2 (B. Tech) Cadet Entry Scheme is for the Navy. Just like NDA exam, these exams are also conducted twice a year. 

You just need to appear in JEE Mains. You need not write any separate written examination. Applications will be shortlisted based on the JEE performance. Then you need to clear Services Selection Board (SSB), and then a medical exam. 

The students will be provided with engineering degrees (B. Tech) once they pass out. That’s why only science stream students can appear in these exams, i.e. those having Physics, Chemistry and Maths (PCM) in their 12th. Also, there is a percentage cut-off, e.g. you need to have 60-70% aggregate marks in Physics, Chemistry and Maths (PCM) in 12th, and 50% marks in English.

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Technical Entry Scheme (TES) and Cadet Entry Scheme are for unmarried male candidates only. But in future, government may open them for female candidates too, just like they did for NDA.

## Career in defence after Graduation

There are multitudes of opportunities to get into Indian armed forces after you have done your graduation. In fact, there are many more ways available once you graduate, than you had when you just completed 12th. I also got into Air Force only after completing my B. Tech in Information Technology. 

Unlike many other government jobs, in most of the armed forces recruitment exams for graduates, even those in final year can apply. Let’s see what routes are open for graduates, to get into that coveted uniform. 

### Combined Defence Services (CDS)

This is probably the most well-known exam for graduates to get into armed forces (just like NDA is for 12th pass students). It’s conducted two times a year. 

Just like NDA, there’s no minimum percentage requirement here. Any graduate or those in final year may appear in CDS. 

Through CDS you can get into Army, Air Force, Navy and Officers' Training Academy (OTA). 
OTA jobs can be filled by females too. Also, there’s no Maths paper in OTA exam and the cut-offs are comparatively lower. 

### Air Force Common Admission Test (AFCAT)

This is an entrance examination to get into Air Force. Just like CDS, it’s conducted two times a year.
You may get recruited as Pilot, in Technical Branch (as engineers) and in other departments like logistics. Females can also apply in this exam. 

To appear in this exam, you must have atleast 60% marks in graduation (whether it’s B. Tech, BSc. etc.), as well as in 12th class. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

I got into Air Force through AFCAT only. 
</div>

### University Entry Scheme (UES) 

This is one of the few routes via which you can become an officer in armed forces without giving a written exam. It is only for B. Tech (Bachelor of Technology) and B. E. (Bachelor of Engineering) students, and no other graduates. 

This is only for male candidates as of now. But things may change soon.

Teams from armed forces may visit university campuses and recruit B. Tech students directly through an interview. Though in some cases, they may conduct some in-campus written tests too. They may put in some eligibility criteria too, e.g. minimum percentage marks. It all depends on how many students in a given campus show their interest. If many students show their interest, then they will eliminate some of them using such methods. Afterall you cannot conduct interviews for hundreds of students. 

Once selected, you may appear in SSB directly. Even pilots are recruited through this recruitment process. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

If you are in B. Tech and interested in joining armed forces, then you may talk to the Campus Placement Department of your college and ask them to invite army, navy and air force teams to your campus. 
</div>

### Judge Advocate Entry (JAG Entry)

If you are a law graduate with atleast 55% marks and are registered in bar council, then you can apply here. Even females can appear.

You need not write any written exam. You can appear directly in SSB. 

### Special entries for NCC

If you have done NCC and are a graduate, then you are eligible to get into armed forces through this route. Even females can appear. 

You need not write any written exam. You can appear directly in SSB. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

There are various levels in NCC. You must have cleared certain levels. You will need to have a look at their notification to find out the details.

## Defence services jobs for females

Though we have pointed out in the jobs/exams mentioned above, wherever females are allowed to appear. However, here we will list down the armed forces jobs available for girls once again.

* NDA exams for 12th pass (or appearing)
* Combined Defence Services (CDS) Officers' Training Academy (OTA) jobs for graduates

  <b>Note</b><br>

After 1st January, 2004, Army, Navy and Air Force are the only central government jobs of India where you will still get pension (after you have served 15-20 years). Here, you don’t need to contribute anything to your pension fund. 

In all other government jobs (including Paramilitary forces, Coastal Guards, etc.), you can only get contributory kind of pension, i.e. you will add some sum in your pension fund on a monthly basis, and the government will also contribute some.
