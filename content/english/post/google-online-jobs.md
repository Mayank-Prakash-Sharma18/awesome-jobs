## Two ways to earn money from Google

There are two ways by which you can get paid by Google, that too by working from home. Moreover, you need not wait for a year to get your appraisal like in any other traditional job. You can earn as much as you want. It all boils down to the quality of content you are fishing out and the amount of time you are putting in.

### Google Online Job Number 1: Online Blog

Once your blog is up and running and is attracting some decent level of crowd, you can monetize it by putting ads. 

Though there are other organizations too that provide ads for your online assets, but Google AdSense is by far the most famous. It’s probably going to provide you your first online income in digital marketing field. 

Here’s what you are supposed to do to earn income from Google AdSense:

Create a blog on any niche of your choice, using Wordpress CMS or some Static site generator like HUGO.
Start posting content on your blog on a regular basis. You site should seem alive to Google. Keep on improving and updating your articles.

Once your blog starts getting a decent amount of traffic, you can monetise your website by applying for Google AdSense (https://www.google.co.in/adsense/). You should get approval if the content on your site is plagiarism free, you have decent traffic and you have fulfilled some of the basic requirements, e.g., having a policy page and terms & conditions page etc. 

Now place AdSense ads on your blog and start earning money. 

## Google Online Job Number 2: YouTube channel

Apart from making a blog, you can create your own YouTube channel. Instead of text, here we will be creating video content. 

It will take more skills and effort on your part to create video content. But you may tap into a very different section of target audience and gain instant fame by doing so. 

Just as a blog, as soon as you start getting some views, you may monetize your YouTube channel and start earning money via ads.

Here’ what you are supposed to do to nail this Google online job:

Start a YouTube channel. If you have a Gmail account, you can create your YouTube channel. In fact, you can open multiple YouTube channels by using just one Gmail account. It’s as simple as that.

Now you may start creating your videos and uploading them. All you will need is a mic, a video editor like Camtasia and probably a camera etc. Keep in mind that a good quality audio is the most important aspect of a video content. Be consistent in uploading the videos.

Once you get a decent number of subscribers, you may apply for YouTube partner program. 
Once your channel is approved, you will start seeing ads on your videos. 


## Winding Up
