Government jobs are always in huge demand, be in central government or those at the state-level. They offer long-term job security, social status and even good salary. 

Candidates focus most of their effort and time on the written test, and eventually get good at it too. However, many of us are not comfortable with the interview stage. Some of the candidates who have never appeared in an interview, may even be apprehensive of this stage – maybe you are just nervous, or you think you have bad verbal communication skills, or not that impressive personality. Maybe you just have the fear of unknown. 

Though with some practice and mock interview exposure you may gain command over this stage too. But if you are really afraid of the interview stage, but still want to get a government job, we have good news for you. There are many good government jobs wherein you need not appear for an interview (or group discussion for that matter).

  <b>Note</b><br>

Modi government removed interview stage from many jobs' recruitment process, especially the central Group B, C and D jobs. This was a move to reduce the corruption and partiality issues faced by many candidates at the interview stage and make the recruitment process fairer and more transparent.

Even UP Government has abolished interview for Group B, C and D jobs, such as Gram Vikas Adhikari, etc. 

However, if you are trying to get a Group A job anywhere, be it at the centre or at the state level, be prepared for an interview.

## Government jobs without interview stage

### Staff Selection Commission (SSC Exams)

The exams conducted by SSC have no interview stage, be it SSC CGL, SSC CHSL or SSC MTS. So, you just need to give an objective test and then maybe a descriptive test and maybe a skill test (typing test) to get selected. 

SSC CGL is for graduates or more qualified candidates, and the jobs that you get here are assistants to various central ministries, inspectors (income tax, custom, narcotics etc.), NIA, CBI, CAG etc. 

12th pass students can sit for SSC CHSL and 10th pass students may sit for SSC MTS. 

### IBPS Clerk and SBI Clerk Exams

IBPS conducts exams for bank probationary officials and clerks (and some other posts). So does State Bank of India (SBI). A few years ago, there used to be an interview stage for bank clerks, but it has been abolished now. 

So, you may sit for IBPS clerk exam, SBI clerk exam or any other such exam for central government bank (Public Sector Bank) clerk position. You will just have to give a few written tests. 

### Technical jobs

There are some technical jobs out there that do not have an interview stage. Let’s see a few of them:
* Railway Recruitment Board - Junior Engineer (RRB JE) – this exam is conducted once every 2-3 years.
* Railway Recruitment Board - Senior Section Engineer (RRB SSE) – but this exam is not conducted on a regular basis. 
* Staff Selection Commission - Junior Engineer (SSC JE) – this exam is conducted once every 2-3 years.

As far as states are concerned, the recruitment process varies. Some states conduct interview for Junior Engineer (JE) posts, while some don’t. You will have to look at their recruitment process in respective notification. 

Apart from the above mentioned technical jobs, in most of the other technical jobs you will most probably have to go through some sort of interview process (except maybe some Information Technology jobs). 


## Government jobs without an exam or an interview

There are also some government posts where you need not give even a written test, leave alone an interview. But most of these jobs are in Group D category. 

Here’ a list of a few of these jobs:

* Indian Army soldier – you need not give a written test, or interview. But physical examination will be there, e.g. foot race. Also, a medical check-up will be conducted and you will have to qualify some basic physical criteria like height, chest width etc. 

* Para-military force – Para-military forces like BSF also conduct direct entries without any written examination.

  <b>Note</b><br>

If you are a NCC cadet, then you may get into armed forces and para-military forces without giving any written test or interview. You will just have to give physical and medical test.

* Peons, Cooks, Cleaners and Drivers in various government departments – In most of these jobs you may not have to give any written test or interview. Though recruitment process may vary from one department to another. But you may have to prove your relevant experience, and most probably your skills will be put to test, i.e. how well you cook, how well you drive etc. 


## Winding Up

So, there are multitude of quality government jobs that do not require you to appear in front of an interview panel. 

However, you will have to face an interview and even group discussion in some of the best government jobs, e.g. Armed Forces officers, Para-military Commanders, IAS, IPS, Bank POs, LIC AAOs etc. 

So, we suggest you to work a little on your soft skills – presentation, communication etc. All this will help you gain confidence for the interview stage. 

It won’t even take much time either. Join some good English-speaking course or personality development program in your city. Make sure you join a batch where they conduct interviews and group discussions. You may also practice with your friends and family, and maybe in front of the mirror. You will be a champion of the interview stage in no time.

Don’t let this interview stage get in the way of you getting a good government job. But even if you can’t, don’t’ worry. Just try the jobs mentioned in this article. 

Best of luck from our side!

  <b>Note</b><br>

In private sector jobs you will have to give some sort of interview (or some sort of verbal interaction), no matter what the job is – that of a director or that of a peon.
