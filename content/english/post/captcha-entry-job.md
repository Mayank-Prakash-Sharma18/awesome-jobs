First of all, let us understand what CAPTCHA entry job is.

## What is a CAPTCHA ?

You must have filled some CAPTCHAs while trying to login to some websites or forums. It is an image or a set of images that you need to solve before you can login to certain websites. 

Often you have to check a checkbox before the CAPTCHA appears.

It ensures that you are a human and not a robot/bot. Because only a human can read and understand the verification code written in the image of a CAPTCHA. Otherwise, hackers may spam a website and send thousands of login requests at the same time, so as to overwhelm the server and bring down the website. 

## Types of CAPTCHAs

You will in general encounter these kinds of CAPTCHAs:

* Word image CAPTCHAs: A distorted image of a word or alphanumeric set will be shown and you will have to copy that in a text box.

This is the most common type of CAPTCHA and this is what you are most likely to encounter if you do a CAPTCHA filling job. 

* Multiple image CAPTCHAs: A set of images will be shown (generally having 9 images) and you will have to click the ones that you are asked to do. Sometimes, new images appear once you click the old ones.

* Mathematical image CAPTCHAs: Sometimes we are provided with a simple mathematical equation to solve.

## What is CAPTCHA entry job?

If you take on a CAPTCHA entry job, you will be filling out CAPTCHAs. 

You will sign up on the website of a company that provides CAPTCHA typing work. Once you login to their admin panel, you can start filling CAPTCHA. 

An image will be loaded and you will have type in the word or alphanumeric pattern visible in that image. After that you will submit it.

If you have done a correct entry, you will see a success message. Otherwise, you will see an error or fail message. Remember, you will be paid only for the correct entries. 

The number of CAPTCHAs that you can fill in a day, the minimum entries required in a month, the amount paid per CAPTCHA and the date of payment will differ with each website. 

Also, you will be paid only when you get to some minimum amount, say Rs. 500. 

## Requirements for CAPTCHA entry job

All you need to do this job is a computer or a mobile and a good internet connection. Apart from this you should have a decent typing speed. Even 20-30 words per minute is good enough for this job. 

There’s no skill or certificate required. You will have to give no test or interview. 

## Where can we find CAPTCHA entry jobs?

There are various websites where you can signup/register and start filling CAPTCHAs. Registration is free on most of the genuine websites. 

Note: If any website is asking you to pay some money upfront, in order to register and do CAPTCHA filling job, then more often than not that site will be a scam site. 

Never pay any registration fee to a website that offers you to get a job. Fraud websites try to make use of the desperation of a person looking for a job. It’s pathetic!

This rule applies generally to all websites providing work from home online jobs and not just CAPTCHA entry job websites. 

## Best CAPTCHA entry work sites

Here’s a list of the best websites where you can find CAPTCHA entry work:

* MegaTypers
* ProTypers
* Kolotibablo
* CaptchaTypers
* 2Captcha
* Captcha2Cash
* VirtualBee
* Qlinkgroup
* PixProfit

Try these out and work on 1-2 of those sites that you find the best. 

## How much can we earn by filling CAPTCHAs?

To be frank, this is not a high paying job. In general, you will be paid $1 (around Rs. 70) per 1000 CAPTCHAs. It keeps on changing. It varies from website to website and even on the same website it may vary from one time to another. 

Even if you fill 5 CAPTCHAs per minute, you can only fill 900 CAPTCHAs in 3 hours. But you will take much more time than that, because no one can work non-stop. Also, sometimes you will have to wait till new CAPTCHA is uploaded. 

So, even if you work 8-10 hours a day, you will earn around Rs. 200-250. That’s too low! 

If you invest 4-5 hours daily, then you may expect to earn Rs. 4000 to 7000 per month. So, consider this CAPTCHA entry job only as a part time job that will give you some extra bucks. 

Do Not make this your full-time job! There are better jobs and gigs available in the market that will pay you better and also add to your skill level. 

It’s a good option for housewives and students, who can do it in their spare time. The amount you earn will also depend on the platform where you do this job and your speed of filling out the CAPTCHAs. 

But I will recommend you to do this job only if you have no other option at the time being. Do not invest all your time into it; 2-3 hours a day will be more than enough. It may help you tide over the bad times and earn basic bread and butter.

## Pros of CAPTCHA entry job

Let us see the benefits of CAPTCHA entry job.

* You do not need any specific skill to do this job. If you have basic knowledge of computer and web surfing, you are good to go. Also, you are not required to give any test or interview to get this job.
* This is purely a work from home job. You can even do it using your mobile. 
* There are no targets and no fixed timings of work. You get paid as much as you work. CAPTCHA filling work can be done 24/7, anytime and from anywhere. 

## Cons of CAPTCHA entry job

Now let us see the downsides of this job.

* The renumeration is very low. Even though many people claim to earn 40-50 thousand doing CAPTCHA filling work, most of these claims are untrue. Especially, if you are in India, the payment will be very meagre. 
* Filling CAPTCHAs is not a skill-set. You learn nothing new. You can never add this experience in your resume. So, CAPTCHA works pays less in present time and adds no value to our future. 
* The work you get will not be continuous. Sometimes you will have to wait long before a new CAPTCHA is uploaded. This will waste a lot of your time. 

## Winding Up

You may give CAPTCHA filling job a try. See if it suits you. 

It may help you earn some extra bucks, but NEVER make this your full-time endeavour. 

You should rather invest your time and energy in honing skills that will ensure your growth in future. But if you are in dire need of money, then for short-term this CAPTCHA filling job is not a bad option. Go for it!
