Whatsapp is one of the most popular messaging apps. Almost everyone with a smart phone uses it, especially in India. In fact, the largest number of Whatsapp users are in India, around 45 crores. But do you know that you can even make money using Whatsapp?

Though there is no direct way to earn money from Whatsapp, unlike YouTube and Facebook, but there are various ways to earn money indirectly. That is, Whatsapp will not pay you money, but you can still earn from other sources using the Whatsapp platform. 

Moreover, most of the methods that we will discuss here require no investment on your part. You just need a smartphone with Whatsapp installed and a decent internet connection. 

Though the earning may not be very high, but you can expect to earn Rs. 5000 to Rs. 10,000 a month. It's decent, given that you are not supposed to make any investment.

## Share Referral links 

There are many websites and apps that pay you some money when you share their links, or when people install their apps or make an account on their website/app. So, you can share these referral links to your friends and relatives. Many apps will not only pay you, but also the person who is getting the link or opening account in their app. So, it won't be hard for you to convince your friends/relatives to do so. 

However, the amount may not be too huge. Expect anywhere between Rs. 100 to 500. But say you have a Whatsapp group with many members and you ask them to do so, you can imagine the amount of money you can make.

  <b>Warning</b><br>

But always make sure that the app or website you are referring is genuine and not a scam, a spy app or a fake one. Some apps that have paid money to people for opening accounts are - InstaMojo, many Stock market apps (e.g. Upstox, Angel Broking, Kotak Securities, 5 Paisa etc.), Dhani app etc. 

But keep in mind, that apps pay money to people only in the initial few months/years. It's their marketing strategy to gain popularity and get more people to use their apps. In due course of time, when they become popular, they will stop doing so.

## Affiliate Marketing

You can join any affiliate marketing program, e.g. Amazon Affiliate Marketing program, and share links of others' products and services on Whatsapp. These affiliate networking programs pay some percentage of commission to you when a customer buys a product/service using your affiliate link. 


Apart from this, if you are a businessman, then you can also use WhatsApp in the following ways.

## Setup Whatsapp Business account

Apart from a personal account, Whatsapp also allows you to setup a business account. If you are a trader or an entrepreneur who wants to sell online, it's something you can explore. 

You can shoot a lot of messages to your existing customers or potential target customers using your Business Whatsapp account. Sending a message via Whatsapp is much cheaper than sending bulk SMS. 

Also, it has been seen that people reply to or respond to Whatsapp messages much more promptly than they do to SMS or e-mails. People may ignore many SMS or e-mails, but they seldom ignore a Whatsapp message. 

Your Whatsapp message will also remain on the receipient's phone for sometime, while if you call them, they may cut the call and forget about it. On the other hand, they may scroll through their Whatsapp messagees and reply when they are free. So, you can see how Whatsapp has some edge over other methods of marketing, like SMS, e-mail and call marketing.

To send bulk messages from Whatsapp, you may run it on desktop/laptop and install a Chrome extension (there are many) that will allow you to send bulk messages.

## Setup a digital showroom

Yes, you can setup a digital showroom and sell online using Whatsapp. If you are an entrepreneur or a seller, do explore this option. 

Now there are various apps available on Google Play Store that integrate pretty well with Whatsapp. Many of them allow you to setup your digital showroom, where you can place your products and then share your online shop and its products with your Whatsapp contacts. It will help you create an online customer base and be in touch with all your customers. 

So, if you are very active on Whatsapp, are a member of many groups and have many friends in your contact list, you can earn some decent amount of money using Whatsapp, or boost your business. If you have a business in India, you should definitely explore Whatsapp, which has such a huge user base here.
