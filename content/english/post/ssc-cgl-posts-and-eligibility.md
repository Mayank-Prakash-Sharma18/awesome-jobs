## Posts offered in SSC CGL

Let’s have a look at the various posts that are offered through SSC CGL exam, i.e. the jobs that we can get through SSC CGL exam.

* Assistant Audit Officer post is offered by Indian Audit & Accounts Department under C&AG. 
* It is a ***higher paygrade post*** and is the only ***gazetted post*** offered via SSC CGL. 
* You will be assigned to a zone. However, you will often have to go on tours to different cities for auditing work within that zone. 

### Assistant Accounts Officer

* Assistant Accounts Officer post is also offered by Indian Audit & Accounts Department under C&AG.
* Just like Assistant Audit Officer, it is a ***higher paygrade post***. Also, you may get promotions at a faster rate. 
* You will be assigned to a zone here too.

### Assistant Section Officer (ASO)

ASOs get a bit lower paygrade than Assistant Audit Officer and Assistant Accounts Officer.

This post is offered by many government departments and institutes. We have listed down a few of them:
* ASO in Central Secretarial Service (DOPT): You may get posting in Delhi. That’s why it’s preferred by many. It’s a 9 to 5 job, but you may have to be punctual (due to biometric based attendance) and work hard. You may get to work in any ministry under the central government. 
* ASO in Ministry of External Affairs (Cadre Cell): You will be based in Delhi, but you may get a chance to serve outside the country too. Obviously, when posted in a foreign country you will get a higher pay (than what you get in India). However, expect a fair amount of workload in this job. 
* ASO in AFHQ (Ministry of Defence): As it’s a security-related job, expect higher levels of discipline, e.g. no mobile phone allowed in office hours, etc. Though you will get many peripheral benefits like access to army canteen, etc.
