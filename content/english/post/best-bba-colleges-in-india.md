If you are interested in BBA course, and are looking for a good college to study in, then you have landed at the right place. In this article, we are going to shed some light on the leading BBA colleges in India and their entrance examinations. 

Most of the reputed central government BBA colleges, state BBA colleges and deemed universities give admission on the basis of an entrance test, rather than just on the basis of the marks scored in 12th class board exams. 

You can join a BBA course after 12th, no matter what your stream was. That is, students from all three streams (science, commerce, arts) can do BBA.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Fees of government colleges are generally lower than that of private colleges. So, return on investment (ROI) is good. Fees in DU colleges is one of the lowest in India, be it BBA or MBA, or any other course. 

For example, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Delhi and Christ University, Bangalore are almost equally good. But fees that you will be required to give in Shaheed Sukhdev College will be much lower.
