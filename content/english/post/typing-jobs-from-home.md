Do you know that you can earn money from home, by just typing? Yes, you can! 

And that too a decent amount of money. You may easily earn anywhere from Rs. 10 thousand to 50 thousand in these online typing jobs, and even more. A lot depends on how much time you are typing, but as a beginner your pay will remain a bit low. 

You need not make any investment or pay any registration fee. So, it's something that's not only a good option for students and housewives, but also for preofessional typists.     

Work from home online typing jobs have always been one of the most sought after jobs. But, with the world witnessing a prolonged lockdown, we saw even further surge in search of these jobs. Moreover, with a major push by almost all organizations to look for office-less options, demand for freelancer typists is only going to increase. 

So, in this article we are going to explore the various online job options that you, as a typist, have at your disposal. Thereafter, we will also have a look at the various websites that are among the best, when it comes to typing jobs.

## Various kinds of Typing jobs

Typing jobs is a general term. Many kinds of jobs fall under this broad category. Let's go into the detail and get to know all these various types of typing jobs. 

### PDF or Word File or Magazine creation

Sometimes the typing work is as simple as converting content from one platform to another. You will typically get the following types of work:
* You may be needed to convert PDF documents, e-books or scanned image files of documents into Microsoft Word documents, or vice-versa. This is the most common type of typing work that you will get online, especially in India.
* More professional typists may also type in advanced software used to make magazines, e.g. Adobe InDesign or PageMaker. But generally publishing houses using such advanced software have their own in-house typists. 

### Captcha typing job

In Captcha typing job you are required to type in the content written in various types of Captcha images. 

### Data Entry work

Data entry work includes gigs like:
* Entering data into excel sheet from some scanned documents.
* Transcription jobs that require you to listen to some audio/video and type what is being said. 

These are the most common typing jobs. Rest of the jobs mentioned below will probably not provide you regular income. Also, they may not be that reliable. But still, let's see them. 

### Copy and Paste jobs

You may just be required to copy from one MS Word file or PDF to another MS Word file or PDF and do some formatting. E.g. you maybe given content in MS Word file and you maybe required to paste it in an e-book and format is properly to make it presentable. 

Sometimes, you maybe required to paste an ad to various sites, say on Faebook, YouTube comment section etc. But here you will generally not get paid based on the number of copy-pastes you did, but rather on the basis of the amount of sales that your links brought. So, this is more of a sales kind of job and not a pure typing work. 

### Survey jobs

Here you will have to complete a survey by answering some basic questions and get paid. Generally, these surveys are not too long. You will be able to complete most of them within 5 minutes. 

Though many other jobs require you to type, but I have not included them in the above list, as they are not pure typing jobs. For example, translation jobs not only require you to type, but also apply your knowledge of the two languages.  


## Requirements for online typing jobs

There are no requirements as such for working as a typist on online platforms. But some sites and companies do take some kind of typing test or have age and educational eligibility criteria like 10th pass or 12th pass etc. 

### Typing test 

You will be asked to type in English or Hindi or whatever language that company makes or needs content in. Typing speed of 40 to 50 words per minute is considered decent. But more than speed, accuracy matters in typing. 

I personally manage a team of around 6 DTP operators and believe me, I will prefer a typist who is 99% accurate, even if he types at half the speed than another typist who is only 90% accurate. High accuracy indicates that the typist is ethical and takes his work seriously. 

Accuracy also depends on the command one has on the language. Sometimes a word is not very clearly written and you will have to guess. A typist who has a better hold on grammar and vocabulary will better be able to guess the spelling of a word or structure of a sentence. 

In some cases you may be required to type Maths and Physics/Chemistry equations, especially if you are joining an educational institute or a publishing house that prints school/college books. 

### Graphics test 

Apart from typing, some companies require their typists to make some basic figures and diagrams, e.g. if you are typing questions and explanations of Geometry, then apart from typing Maths, you may also need to draw some diagrams. 

Though this is the work of Graphic designers, but if you can make some basic figures, then you will be more in demand. 

### Hardware and Software

You should have a computer/laptop and a decent internet connection. As you will be typing a lot, you should get yourself an ergonomics keyboard. 

Also, you should at least be comfortable in MS Word and MS Excel. 

### Work Ethics

Last but not the least, a typist needs to be very ethical. Almost all content of a company goes through a typist. So, a typist should make sure that he is not misusing the content in anyway. 

This work also involves strict deadlines. So, organizations prefer a typist who keeps his commitment on delivery of content. For example, one of my typist is so reliable that he will upload our tests on online test platform even if he has to work all night. He keeps backup of his work in an external drive on a daily basis and even has installed a generator at his home, just in case there is a power-cut. So, I don't care whether he works from home or office. He is ethical and reliable and that's only what matters. 


## Warning: Fake online typing jobs

I have been exploring and working various online jobs since over a decade. I have tried out a wide spectrum of online jobs, from translation, to SEO to typing; some seriously and some just for the sake of trying them out. 

Let me tell you, there are a lot of online job frauds. Some are very easy to spot. For example, if someone asks money from you for any reason, be it registration or software that you will use in the "job" that they will offer you, then most certainly they are taking you for a ride. But other scammers may be more shrewed. I have even written <a href="../work-from-home-scams" title="Static" class="mak-link">an article on it</a>, just in case you want to go in detail. 

For now, just keep this in mind: never pay any registration fee for any online typing job. Registration is free on all genuine websites. No initial investment is needed for this job. 

What we want as a freelancer typist is a website where we can get genuine and regular work. Plus, we should get paid on a timely basis. 

But there are many genuine online typing job opportunities too. You will get them mainly on:
* Freelancing Sites
* Established Company sites
* Online Job Portals

Let's explore some of such websites. 


## Best Websites for Typing jobs

### Typing work on Freelancing Sites

There are various sites dedicated to freelancers. Here you will get a wide variety of jobs, including typing jobs. Very often you will find typing jobs under sections such as 'writing', 'data entry freelancers' etc. 

#### <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">Upwork</a>  

You can signup and make your profile. You can login using Gmail and then fill up your details. You may choose to work as freelancer typist. 

On Upwork, you can see typing jobs under Admin Support â†’ Data Entry Freelancers 

To work on this website, you should preferably have a computer/laptop. But you may even work on this website using your smart phone. 

#### <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">Freelancer</a>  

You will get more than 1300 categories of work here, including typing work. 

Just like Upwork, you need to signup and make your profile, where you tell the potential clients that you are a typist. 

Freelancer also has an app. So, you can work with them using your mobile too. 

#### Some other online freelancing sites offering typing work

* <a href="https://www.simplyhired.co.in/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">SimplyHired</a>   
* <a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">Guru</a>   
* <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">Fiverr</a>   
* <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">PeoplePerHour</a>  

#### <a href="https://www.mturk.com/" target="_blank" title="Static" class="mak-link">Amazon MTurk</a>  

On Amazon MTurk you will find various kinds of online typing jobs. Moreover, you need not do any investment.  


### Typing work on Established Company sites

If you know a company that offers online typing jobs, then you may go to the website of that company and apply directly. Or you may search for 'online typing jobs' in Google and see if any company's website shows up. Sometimes, you may have to go to 2nd or 3rd page to find a suitable company. 

But unlike the jobs that you get on freelancing websites, here you will have to ascertain yourself that the job offer is genuine. Have a look at there website, read reviews about that company on Google and social media etc. 

It will be even better if you can talk to them on phone or meet them personally in their office at least once. This way you will also get a better feel of the kind of job being offered, is it short-term or long-term, how will you get paid, what are their expectations etc. 

Avoid the following types of companies:
* No office, or having office at their home. If they do not want to meet you in their office, then it's suspicious. 
* No phone number listed. 
* No soical media presence. 
* If they are asking for some kind of money, be it registration fee or anything else. 

### Typing work on Online Job Portals

Various typing jobs are listed on online job portals like Naukri, Glassdoor, Monster, Shine etc. Here, you will see not only work from home typing jobs, but also traditional office jobs in the city of your choice. 

These sites are more tuned towards traditional jobs, rather than freelancing jobs. But still you can find some online jobs here, if you know how to search for them. 

If you just want work-from-home jobs, then search for "work from home typing jobs", "online typing jobs" or "freelance typing jobs" on these sites. You will probably get some good online typing work. 

But beware! There may be some fake job offers here. For example, they may get work from you and not pay you. So, be cautious and work for a company that looks genuine. Do check their website and social media accounts.  

Some of them just post fake job postings, even though they don't have any typing jobs. They just want people to visit their site and see the ads on their sites, so that they can earn some online ad money. 


## Winding Up

Typing job is a very intense work. There's always a lot of workload, you have to meet strict deadlines and in return you do not get paid enough. 

So, this work should be seen as part-time work. It's suitable for housewives, college students and for people who like working from home and hate going to a regular office everyday. 

Pure typing work does not need any skills as such and you need not apply your mind. So, there's never going to be much growth in the future, even if you gain a lot of experience. 

If you are working full-time in a company for a long time and have proved that you are reliable, accurate and can manage other typists too, then maybe you will grow a bit. But it is rarely possible in work-from-home arrangement. 

If you want to get paid more while typing online, then you should also explore other options, where you will need to use some other skills too. For example, translation jobs, article writing, e-book creation etc.
