  <b>Warning</b><br>

You should always verify that the app or website you are referring is genuine and not a scam, a trojan, virus or a fake one. Some apps that have paid money to people for opening accounts are - InstaMojo, many stock market apps (e.g. Upstox, Angel Broking, Kotak Securities, 5 Paisa etc.), Dhani app etc. 

Apps pay people as a part of their marketing strategy (i.e. to gain popularity), especially in the initial years after their launch. Once they gain enough number of installations, they discontinue the referral scheme. So, you will have to keep on exploring the genuine apps that are running these paid referral schemes.

## Affiliate Marketing

You can promote others' products and services. You can join any affiliate marketing program, e.g. Amazon Affiliate Marketing program, and share links of products and services via your Telegram account or channel. You will get paid a certain amount of commission whenever anyone makes a purchase via your affiliate link. 

## Setup a digital showroom

Yes, you can sell online using Telegram app. If you are an entrepreneur or into sales, you should explore this option. If you have a big channel, then you will get a lot of sales from here. You can also use it to promote your services, e.g. your online classes, or your YouTube channel etc. 

But before you start selling things, you should focus more on making your channel big. To do so, you can share informational content, memes etc. For example, if you are into education/coaching, you can share notes, infographics etc. 

Once you get enough subscribes in public channel, you can create a private channel. This private channel will be like a VIP membership channel. Only those people will be able to access it, who have its link. It will not be available to general public. So, you can funnel the subscribers on your public channel to your private channel, where you can provide exclusive content in return of some fee. That is, you may sale your services like educational videos, notes, e-books, here.
