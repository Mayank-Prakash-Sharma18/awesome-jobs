Have you been terrified of Maths all of your school life? It was tough, isn’t it. I was also weak in Maths till 9th class, though I fell in love with it thereafter. So, I understand the anxiety that some aspirants feel regarding Maths. 

In fact, many of us took a sigh of relief when they got a choice to take Biology, Commerce, or Arts after 10th class. Once we dropped Maths from our curriculum, we thought it’s over. Only if the life was so simple!

Once you start preparing for campus placements, or jobs (private or government), or even for higher studies, you will find that Maths is almost everywhere. Almost all private companies take some kind of aptitude test having Maths, Reasoning questions. Same is true if you want to do MBA – you will find Maths in CAT, XAT, GMAT, GRE etc. If you want to do law, you will have to deal with Maths again, say in CLAT. If you decide to become IAS, you will again have to deal with it in CSAT exam. So, you get an idea. 

In this article, we are not going to preach you to get good in Maths. Though you can, but we understand that some cannot. And it’s fine. There are still many good jobs that you may try to get in. 
Here we will list down some of the Indian government jobs that ask:
* no Maths questions at all.
* only a few easy-level Maths questions.

## Government exams without Maths

In the following jobs you will not have to face the dreaded Maths questions at all. Yeahhh! 

### Lok Sabha Protocol Executor

It’s generally known by the name of Protocol Officer. It’s a central government job. As Lok Sabha (Parliament) is in Delhi, you will be posted in Delhi. 

In this exam no Maths is asked. There’s an objective type paper that has questions from subjects like Polity, General Awareness, English etc. This paper is more in the pattern of UPSC IAS Preliminary General Studies paper. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Even if they decide to ask some Maths/Reasoning questions some year, they will be only a few and of easy difficulty level. 
</div>

It’s a pretty good job. When I gave it in 2012, I cleared the written examination. But later on, they told me that I had to be post-graduate to sit in this exam. As I was only a B. Tech graduate, I was disqualified. So, do read the notification properly regarding their criteria. 

### Public Service Commissions’ Exams (UPSC and State PSCs)

State PSCs recruit aspirants for state jobs like SDM, Deputy SP, lower court judges, BDO etc. 
Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) recruit aspirants for central government jobs like DM (IAS), SP (IPS), IRS (Revenue), etc.  

In many State PSC jobs, no Maths is asked. While in some state PSCs and UPSC exams only a few Maths questions are asked, and the marks you get there are not added in the merit list. You just need to get a minimum percentage of marks.

For example, in UPSC exam, there is a CSAT paper in the preliminary round. It has 80 questions, out of which around 30 are reading comprehension questions, 20-30 are reasoning questions and around 20-25 are maths questions. It’s just a qualifying paper. So, you just need 33% marks in this paper. Merit list is made on the basis of your performance in General Studies (GS) paper only. 

Focus of these exams, that recruit administrative officers, is more on General Studies and Current Affairs. 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

Almost all of the exams conducted by UPSC (and State PSCs) focus more on General Studies and Current Affairs, rather than on Maths.

### Airforce Airmen

Student of any stream can become an Airforce Airmen – doesn’t matter you had Maths/Science, Arts or Commerce in school. 

While Group X is for the technical jobs, and so only students who had Maths and Science in 10+2 (or Diploma holders) can sit for it. Group Y jobs can be filled by students of any stream. 

Airforce releases this vacancy on its portal. So, keep an eye on that. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

While Group X and Y exams are for Airforce Airmen, you may give AFCAT if you are a graduate and want to become an officer. Only a few Maths questions come in AFCAT, say 10-15, and they are not that difficult. 
</div>

### OTA (Officers Training Academy)

Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam has a separate Maths paper for most of the jobs. But you will have to give the Maths paper only if you want to become Air Force pilot or get into Army. 

However, if you are applying for OTA (Officers Training Academy) job, then you need not give the Maths paper. You just need to give English and General Studies papers. It’s also a Class-I job. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Main challenge in armed forces recruitment is not the written paper anyways. The real challenge is to clear Services Selection Board (SSB) stage. I cleared Air Force SSB in Varanasi for Technical officer post in the year 2009. I will share that experience of mine in a separate article. 
</div> 

### Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Stenographer 

Maths Is not asked in this exam. Questions are asked from English, Reasoning, General Studies etc. You also need to give a typing test. It’s a central government job (Grade C and D). 

Some other central government Stenographer jobs have been mentioned below:
* CBSE Junior Assistant and Stenographer exams – Minimal Maths is asked in these exams. 12th pass students can appear for CBSE Junior Assistant exam. For CBSE Stenographer job you must be a graduate. 
* Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Stenographer exam – ESIC comes under central government’s Ministry of Labour and Employment. Thousands of vacancies are released every year. Its exam pattern, difficulty level etc. are very similar to SSC Stenographer exam, i.e. there’s no Maths section in this exam. You will only encounter reasoning, English and general awareness questions. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Apart from SSC Stenographer and other such central government jobs, many state level organizations also recruit typists and stenographers separately, e.g. state departments, High Courts, etc. So, explore these options too if you are a typist. In most of these exams, you won’t have to deal with Maths. Even if you have to, it will be very easy.
</div>

### Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Services Selection Commission (UPSSSC) 

Just like SSC recruits people for central government departments, UPSSSC recruits people for UP government departments. People from other states can also give this exam. 

You may get selected in various posts through this exam, e.g. Stenographer, Junior Assistant, Lower Division Clerk (LDC), Upper Division Clerk (UDC), Computer operator etc.

In most of its exams only Hindi, Reasoning (General Intelligence) and GK questions are asked (no Maths). 
So, explore it too. 

You may also have a look at state SSCs of various other states. 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

As you can see, if you are not good in Maths then make sure that you are good in English, Reasoning, General Studies, Current Affairs etc.

## Government Jobs with easy Maths

Apart from the jobs mentioned above, there are some other government jobs that do check your Maths knowledge, but the difficulty level is pretty easy. So, if you can manage easy level of Maths, then you may explore these jobs too. 

* Railways Loco Pilot and Ticket Checker (TT) – Very few Maths questions are asked, that too of easy or medium difficulty level. Questions are mainly asked from English, Reasoning, Current Affairs etc. Loco Pilot is the driver of trains and you also need an ITI diploma for this job. 
* Provident Fund Officer – UPSC conducts this exam to recruit Class-I officers to Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Though this exam is not held regularly every year, but it’s a nice job. Only few easy Maths questions are asked. Major part of the paper comprises questions from General Studies, i.e. History, Polity, Science, Economics, etc. Do study a bit about Provident fund and Labour Act too. 
* UPSC Assistant Commandant (CAPF) – To get selected as commanding officers in organizations like BSF, CRPF, CISF etc. It’s a class-I central government job. Maths is only asked in preliminary examination, and not in mains. Only a few easy maths questions are asked, as UPSC gives more stress to General Studies (GS). 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

UPSC Assistant Commandant is to become officer in paramilitary forces. But, if you want to get recruited as sub-inspector in para-military organizations, then you can give Staff Selection Commission Central Police Organization (SSC CPO) exam. Here, maths is only asked in the preliminary round, not in mains. Also, there’s no sectional cut-off. So, even if you do not do good in maths section, but do great in other sections, you will clear the prelims. 
</div>

* Intelligence Bureau (IB) Personal Assistant and Security Assistant – Very easy maths questions are asked in these exams (around 20 out of a total of 100 questions). 10th pass students can appear for IB Security Assistant exam. For IB Personal Assistant (IB - PA) job you must be 12th pass. 
* KVS LDC (Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Lower Division Clerk job) – 12th pass students can apply. Very few and very simple maths questions are asked (around 15 maths questions out of a total of 100 questions). 
* NVS LDC (Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti Lower Division Clerk job) – 12th pass students can apply. Very few and very simple maths questions are asked (around 20 maths questions out of a total of 180 questions).

Apart from these jobs, there are some exams where Maths is at most of medium difficulty level. For example:
* Staff Selection Commission exams like SSC CHSL, SSC MTS – Though there are a lot of Maths questions in these exams, but they are not very difficult. These exams give more stress on English, General Knowledge, General Studies, Reasoning and maybe Typing, Physical Test and Computer Knowledge. The Maths and Reasoning questions asked in these exams are far easier than those asked in SSC CGL and Bank PO exams. SSC CHSL is for 12th pass students, and SSC MTS is for 10th pass students. 
* Insurance exams like LIC AAO, LIC ADO - Even Maths asked in LIC AAO, LIC ADO and non-life insurance companies’ paper is far easier that that of SSC CGL. Same is true for Bank Clerk exams.
