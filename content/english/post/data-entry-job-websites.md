## What are data entry jobs?

Data entry is largely a clerical and mechanical kind of work. That is, you need not apply much of your mind or have much skills or experience. So, they are simple routine tasks, which are super easy to do. 

Therefore, they make a perfect starting point for just about anyone to break into the world of online work.

Following types of jobs fall under the category of data entry jobs:

* Data entry into excel sheets or word document from other types of documents. Data may be numeric or alphabetic. 

* Data entry of figures or data into database or book-keeping software. For example, entering invoice receipt data into database of some company. 

* Classify and tag different types of data, e.g. images. For example, you may be asked to write tags for 30 pictures of dogs, explaining what is going on in the picture. This classified data may be used in various ways by a company, e.g. it may be used to train their Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) software.

* Have you seen articles wherein there are tables comparing various products or services. For example, comparing three models of Harley Davidson, say Iron 883, 48 and street. You may be asked to find the various facts to fill-in that table, e.g. the engine thrust, road clearance etc. 

* Simple copy-paste work. 

* Captcha Entry Job

Some people keep transcription jobs under data-entry jobs. But as per me it's a different type of job altogether.

Transcription - you are supposed to listen to audio/video and type it down in word document or some other software.
