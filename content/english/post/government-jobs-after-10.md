## Government jobs for 10th pass female

Many jobs in Group D category are available only for men, e.g. peon, guards etc. However, females may apply in most of the other jobs mentioned above. Just have a look at the notification released for a particular job before you apply. 

With time, government is opening even many security-related jobs for women. So, stay tuned!


## Which stream is best for government jobs after 10th?

As most of us study the same subjects till 10th (except a few choices, say computer or commerce), the stream does not matter that much for 10th level jobs. It matters more for 12th level and graduation level jobs. 

There are some jobs after 12th that are only for science stream students, especially for Maths and Science students, e.g. NDA science stream recruitment, DSSSB Lab Assistant etc. 

Moreover, if the job you are applying for conducts a written objective test, then your chances of getting selected will improve if you are good in Maths and English. So, focus more on these subjects in school. Even if you are from arts or commerce stream, you should be comfortable with Maths and English, and maybe subjects like Science, Geography, History too. Also, get into a habit of reading a good newspaper on a daily basis for current affairs. 


## Winding Up

Though we encourage you to keep on studying and complete your 12th and probably graduate too, before you start looking for jobs. As good quality and high paying jobs depend on your education level. A lot many jobs will be open to you once you graduate. 

Also, the competition is high for 10th level jobs, because some 12th pass, graduates and even post-graduates apply for these jobs. 

However, if you want to discontinue your studies due to some reason, or some urgency, or if you want to get financially independent at an early age, then go ahead and explore the government jobs mentioned in this article. 

Best of luck from our side!
